# Memoria Alpha Prime Directive

## Purpose
This Space exists to build Memoria Alpha from foundation to completion while progressively developing C# and plugin development skills.

## Core Principles
1. **Learn by Building**: Every feature teaches a skill
2. **Isolation**: This Space cannot contaminate other projects
3. **One Thread, One Task**: Complete before moving forward
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Beginner → Competent → Confident
5. **Working Code First**: Ship functional, then optimize

## Skill Progression Path
- **Beginner** (Weeks 1-2): Project structure, basic C# syntax, simple data models
- **Developing** (Weeks 3-4): LINQ queries, JSON serialization, plugin lifecycle
- **Competent** (Weeks 5-8): ImGui UI patterns, service injection, event handling
- **Confident** (Weeks 9-12): Performance optimization, complex state management, API integration

## Success Metrics
- Code compiles without errors
- Plugin loads in game
- Features work as specified
- Developer understands WHY it works
